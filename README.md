# RoamReady

## Project Description

This project is a web application for users to store holiday itineraries. It is part of the DVT Graduate Program 2023.
Designed and developed by Michelle Nowers.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you
change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also
use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a
package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

## Assumptions:

### (for now...)

- uniqueness of trip names and activity names

## Still To Do

- [ ] Error handling for empty fields in login / signup form
- [ ] Sort out routing with home page vs landing page
- [ ] NG-Zorro drop down items are blue on hover
- [ ] Add location to activity form
- [ ] Add a calendar (https://medium.com/allenhwkim/angular-build-a-calendar-in-50-lines-f813f0a04c3b)
- [ ] Add resolvers
- [ ] Disable home button when on home / landing page
- [ ] Remove user feedback for disabled buttons
- [ ] Move dual button groups to their own components?

## Bugs

- when logging in: loading spinner -> login form -> home page
  - ~~if still present after implementing state, try move loading spinner to trips component~~
    - can't cos, resolver...
